Sympli Web Search

Web Search is implemented in the Crawling library

The Caching library implements a simple cache for the searches

There are two application examples using the Web search: ConsoleApp and FormsApp

Caching and Crawling libraries has been tested using the two test projects CachingTests and CrawlingTests

To mark the separation between returned search result, the marker  ***div class="ZINbbc xpd O9g5cc uUPGi"*** has been determined empirically (reading the html source returned).

With default parameters, the search gives 1 match in item 4.
